All of this started one night when I couldn't sleep. I had *just* decided that I was going to quit my job and start something on my own. I had no idea what.. I do know that I like helping people, so I searched Google domains for 'helpingothers.com' -- taken (obviously.) I am hysterical at 3:30am and I thought "Ok let's make <a href="http://helpingotters.com">helpingotters.com</a> work"

And so here we **go** I don't know what this is going to become but let's give it a shot.
